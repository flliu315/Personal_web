abstract: In this study, we have recorded dawn singing activity from April to June 2019 at seven different sites in Yaoluoping National Nature Reserve (YNNR) in the eastern China and examined the effects of extrinsic factors such as temperature and time of the season on the dawn singing behavior of four common birds.The results indicated that bird’s dawn singing activity is species-specific and is sensitive to environmental factors such as temperature and time of the season.
